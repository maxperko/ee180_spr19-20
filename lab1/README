*************************************************************************

In short, we've tried to follow the lecture slide examples for recursive
function calls, as well as for- and while-loop conventions of checking 
conditionals and branching to block bodies only after conditions have 
been met.

Our implementation of the mergesort routine is relatively straightforward
and very well commented, though may not be the most heavily optimized.
We've attempted to preserve all callee saved registers using fewer than 
thirty-two bytes of stack space, per the lecture slide conventions, and
made clever use of all temporary ($t0-t9) registers prior to digging into
callee-saved regs (e.g. $s0-s7).
